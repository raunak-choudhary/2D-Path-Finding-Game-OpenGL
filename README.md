# 2D Path Finding Game

**2D Path Finding Game** is a mini project developed during the 6th semester of the Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate program at Shri Madhwa Vadiraja Institute of Technology and Management (SMVITM), under Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), India.

This project demonstrates a time-bound maze-solving game built using the OpenGL graphics library. The user must navigate a yellow-colored player point from a green start point to a red endpoint within a maze, avoiding walls, before the timer runs out.

## üéÆ Project Overview

- Developed using **OpenGL** with C in **Dev-Cpp (GCC)** environment.
- Designed to test and improve logical reasoning and quick decision-making.
- Includes three difficulty levels:
  - **Easy:** 90 seconds
  - **Medium:** 60 seconds
  - **Hard:** 30 seconds
- Provides full keyboard control for navigation and menu interaction.
- Implements real-time countdown and interactive feedback (win/loss states).

## üß† Educational Objectives

- Apply OpenGL concepts like coordinate transformations, object rendering, and real-time updates.
- Practice modular programming through function-based graphics handling.
- Strengthen understanding of user interaction and interface logic.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Language:** C
- **Graphics Library:** OpenGL (GL, GLU, GLUT)
- **Compiler:** TDM-GCC 4.9.2
- **IDE:** Dev-Cpp 5.11
- **Platform:** Windows 7/10 (64-bit)
